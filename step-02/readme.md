# Step 2 - Shoot the Enemy Bomber

In this step we will use what we have built in the prev step.
Use `starter.htm` as an example

- A series of bombers represented by a colored rect fly from left to right
- bombers fly with a different speed with every appearance (use rnd() function)
- If a bomber reaches the other edge - you lose after 3 missed bombers
- a Rocket launch is triggered by hitting a key (e.g. space)
- a rocket flies from the bottom of the gaming window towards the top - the bomber in the "sky"
- when rocket hits a bomber then it kills it and you get +1 score
